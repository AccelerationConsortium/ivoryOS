# Python-native integration

IvoryOS integrates with normal Python automation code. The preferred pattern is to keep vendor SDK details inside small wrapper classes and expose stable, typed methods to IvoryOS.

## What IvoryOS reads

When `ivoryos.run(__name__)` starts, IvoryOS inspects the active Python module and initialized objects. It uses:

- public function and method names;
- parameter names;
- type hints;
- default values;
- docstrings;
- return annotations.

Those Python API details become direct-control forms, workflow actions, configurable run parameters, generated proxy clients, and design-agent context.

## Basic pattern

```python
class Balance:
    def __init__(self, port: str):
        self.driver = VendorBalance(port=port)

    def tare(self) -> None:
        """Tare the balance."""
        self.driver.tare()

    def read_mass_mg(self) -> float:
        """Read the current mass in milligrams."""
        return self.driver.read_mass(unit="mg")


balance = Balance(port="COM4")

import ivoryos

ivoryos.run(__name__)
```

IvoryOS sees `balance.tare()` and `balance.read_mass_mg()` and exposes them in the UI. The method docstrings and type hints help users understand and configure the actions.

## Keep the public API small

Do not expose every low-level vendor method directly. A good integration wrapper gives users a small set of experiment-level actions:

- `tare()`
- `dose_solid(amount_in_mg: float)`
- `dose_solvent(solvent_name: Solvent, amount_in_ml: float)`
- `equilibrate(temp: float, duration: float)`
- `analyze(sample_id: str) -> float`

Private helper methods should be prefixed with `_` so they are treated as implementation details.

## Separate hardware from workflow

Keep hardware implementation inside driver or wrapper classes. Keep workflow composition in IvoryOS.

```text
Vendor SDK / serial driver
          |
          v
Small Python wrapper class
          |
          v
IvoryOS-generated controls and workflow actions
          |
          v
Reusable visual workflows
```

This separation lets automation engineers update hardware code without asking users to rebuild workflows from scratch.

## Integration checklist

- Add clear type hints to public methods.
- Add defaults for common values.
- Use `Enum` for fixed choices that should appear as dropdowns.
- Add docstrings to methods users will see in the UI.
- Prefix internal helpers with `_`.
- Keep long-running calls synchronous unless the workflow is designed around background execution.
- Regenerate remote proxy clients after changing method names, argument names, annotations, or return values.
