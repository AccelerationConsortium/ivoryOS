Welcome to ivoryOS's documentation!
===================================

**ivoryOS** is a Python library aiming to ease up the control of any Python-based SDLs by displaying functions and parameters for initialized modules dynamically.
The modules can be hardware API, high-level functions, or experiment workflow.
With the least modification of the current workflow, user can design, manage and execute their experimental designs and monitor the execution process.
