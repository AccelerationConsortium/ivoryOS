I have some python functions, for example when calling them I want to write them using JSON, 
it is necessary to include all args
for example
def dose_solid(amount_in_mg:float, bring_in:bool=True): def analyze():
dose_solid(3)
analyze()
I would want to write to
[
{
    "action": "dose_solid",
    "arg_types": {
        "amount_in_mg": "float",
        "bring_in": "bool"
    },
    "args": {
        "amount_in_mg": 3,
        "bring_in": true
    }
},
{
    "action": "analyze",
    "arg_types": {},
    "args": {}
}
]

Now these are my callable functions,
	def analyze():
	def dose_solid(amount_in_mg: float = 5, bring_in: bool = False):
		"""
		dose current chemical
		"""
	def dose_solvent(solvent_name: str, amount_in_ml: float = 5, rate_ml_per_minute: float = 1):
	def equilibrate(temp: float, duration: float):
	def filtration():

and I want you to find the most appropriate function if I want to do these tasks
"""dose 10 mg of acetaminophen, and then analyze"""
,and write a list of dictionary in json accordingly. Please only use these action names ['analyze', 'dose_solid', 'dose_solvent', 'equilibrate', 'filtration'], 
can you also help find the default value you can't find the info from my request.
